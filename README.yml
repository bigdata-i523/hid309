         Social Media, as organic and diverse it is, is also a vital source
         of very large amount of data. And it increased even more with the introduction
         of Smart Phones. As it has been established very well in recent years that
         Social Media and the data derived from it not only helps with decision making
         for substantial businesses but also helps considerably for marketing and
          increasing business revenues. We explore various benefits and techniques
         of using Big Data technology Apache Spark in unison with enormous Social
         Media data and how it can overcome the shortcomings of Traditional Analytics
         Technologies. We illustrate application of Spark with Social Media data
         with a few Social Media use cases pertaining to product enhancement and
          marketing.
