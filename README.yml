         Social Media, as organic and diverse it is, is also a vital
         source of very large amount of data. And it increased even
         more with the introduction of Smart Phones. As it has been
         established very well in recent years that Social Media and
         the data derived from it not only helps with decision making
         for substantial businesses but also helps considerably for
         marketing and increasing business revenues. We explore
         various benefits and techniques of using Big Data technology
         Apache Spark in unison with enormous Social Media data and
         how it can overcome the shortcomings of Traditional Analytics
         Technologies. We illustrate application of Spark with Social
         Media data with a few Social Media use cases pertaining to
         product enhancement and marketing.
