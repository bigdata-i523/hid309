   title: BigData Analytics using Apache Spark in Social Media
   abstract: >
       Social Media, as organic and diverse it is, is also a vital
       source of very large amount of data. And it increased even more
       with the introduction of Smart Phones. As it has been established
       very well in recent years that Social Media and the data derived
       from it not only helps with decision making for substantial
       businesses but also helps considerably for marketing and
       increasing business revenues. We explore various benefits and
       techniques of using Big Data technology Apache Spark in unison
       with enormous Social Media data and how it can overcome the
       shortcomings of Traditional Analytics Technologies. We
       illustrate application of Spark with Social Media data with a few
       Social Media use cases pertaining to product enhancement and
       marketing.
